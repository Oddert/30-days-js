			<h1>Day 21: A deep dive into the geolocation API</h1>
			<div>
				<p>
					This challenge looks at the bowser's native geolocation API which allows JS to access information about the device's location (if permitted). Most of the time you'll see this used to get the user's coordinates fo placing them on a map. 
				</p>
				<p>
					This challenge is designed to look at more in-depth features a lot of developers are not aware of; namely the ability to ascertain the device's heading and speed if they're moving.
					Unfortunately this doesn't really work on most desktop browsers, so I've implemented a couple of workarounds here.
				</p>
				<p>
					If you'd like to grab your phone and go walk about, click the "View Original App" link. If you'd still like to see the original app with a mock of the <code>navigator.geolocation.watchPosition</code> API.
					I've also implemented a more "standard" map app which will show the user's location so my desktop-couch-loungers can have something to look at.
