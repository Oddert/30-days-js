# The Javascript 30 Challenge | A Commitment by Oddert

## The Challenge
[The 30 days Javascript challenge](https://javascript30.com/) ([repository](https://github.com/wesbos/JavaScript30)) is a challenge / video course set out by [Wes Bos](https://wesbos.com/)

## My self assigned task
...is to complete the challenges on the course to the best of my ability over each of the 30 days of November.
I'll try to do one a day but will bunch up some where necessary to keep roughly on track.
I'll stick to the strict rules outlined bellow and set up a blog soon to document all this.

## Rules
* No frameworks
* No Compilers
* Complete One challenge a day (flexible because of life)
